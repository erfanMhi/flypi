- Follow PEP 8 standards strictly
- Maximum line length: 79 characters
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use double quotes for strings
- Add docstrings to all public modules, classes, methods, and functions

2. Code Organization:
- Imports should be grouped in the following order:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Related third party imports
  3. Local application/library specific imports
- Separate import groups with a blank line
- You should have two blank lines between top-level functions and classes, and one blank line between methods inside a class.

3. Naming Conventions:
- Use snake_case for functions and variables
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use UPPERCASE for constants
- Prefix private attributes with underscore (_)

4. Type Hints:
- Always include type hints for function parameters and return values
- Use Optional[] for nullable types
- Use List[], Dict[], etc. from typing module

5. Documentation:

- Include type information in docstrings
- Document exceptions that may be raised
- Add inline comments only for complex logic

6. Error Handling:
- Use explicit exception handling
- Create custom exceptions when appropriate
- Avoid bare except clauses

7. When suggesting code:
- Explain any non-obvious design decisions
- Include example usage where appropriate
- Highlight potential performance implications
- Suggest tests when implementing new features

8. Logging:
- Use loguru for logging
- Include appropriate log levels (debug, info, warning, error)
- Add context to log messages

9. Testing:
- Write testable code
- Suggest unit tests for new functionality
- Use pytest for testing framework

10. When making edits:
- Show only the relevant changes
- Include comments to indicate skipped unchanged code
- Explain the reasoning behind significant changes
